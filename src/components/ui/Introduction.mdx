# UI Component Library

This section contains documentation for the reusable UI components used throughout the portfolio application.

## Component Library Structure

The UI components in this project follow a consistent pattern:

- **Core UI Components**: Located in `/src/components/ui/`, these are the foundational building blocks like Button, Carousel, and more.
- **Shared Components**: Located in `/src/components/shared/`, these are higher-level components used across multiple pages, like Container, Header, and Menu.
- **Specialized Components**: Grouped by feature in directories like `/src/components/projects/`, `/src/components/chat/`, etc.

## Theming

The application supports both light and dark themes using `next-themes`. Components automatically adapt to the current theme.

## Internationalization

Components that display text use the `next-intl` library for internationalization:

- Server components use `getTranslations()` from 'next-intl/server'
- Client components use the `useTranslations()` hook

## Accessibility

All interactive components are built with accessibility in mind:
- Proper keyboard navigation
- ARIA attributes
- Semantic HTML

## Usage Guidelines

1. Use server components by default
2. Add `'use client'` directive only when needed (for interactive components)
3. Always define TypeScript interfaces for component props
4. Follow mobile-first responsive design principles
5. Use Tailwind CSS for styling with the `cn()` utility for class merging

## Contributing New Components

When adding new components:
1. Create the component in the appropriate directory
2. Add TypeScript types/interfaces for props
3. Create a corresponding story file for Storybook documentation
4. Follow existing patterns for theming and responsiveness
